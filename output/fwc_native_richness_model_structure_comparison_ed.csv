random effect for location reduces estimates,,,,,,,,,
random effect for year doesn't change estimates much,,,,,,,,,
fixed effect for location doesn't change estimates,,,,,,,,,
fixed effect for time changes estimates a lot and is significant,,,,,,,,,
difference response makes all estimates negative,,,,,,,,,
adding initial richness makes richness and difference models equal,,,,,,,,,
